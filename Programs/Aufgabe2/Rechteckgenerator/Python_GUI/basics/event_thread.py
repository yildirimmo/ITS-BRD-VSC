"""
    This thread is a simpled version of a worker thread. Instead of a work queue that stores different
    tasks, this thread can execute only task defined by its function parameter action.
    The thread of this class waits for an event. Wenn this event is set, the threads
        - resets the event
        - executes its run function
        - waits for the next event
